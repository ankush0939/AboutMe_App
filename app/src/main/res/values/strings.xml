    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Ankush.
\n\nI love Coding.
\n\nI like being a free bird, live life to the fullest and complete my bucket list which is quite adventurous.
\nFun fact I think I am an old school type.
\n\nI Sometime get too aggressive and sometimes I don\'t like that about me.
\nI like to be with friends, hanging out and have fun.
\nIt\'s weird for a programmer to be social but I like being.
\n\nI consider my family, friends and job to be most important in life.
\n\nI Work on a lot of things like various frameworks and like exploring the Tech World.
\nAsk me about any tech help and I will try my best to help.\n\n</string>
